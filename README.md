## 🧱 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (3D transforms, box-shadow, animation delays)

## 🚀 How It Works

- The `.loader` uses `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `perspective()` to simulate depth.
- Each `<span>` represents a ring that animates along the Z-axis (`translateZ`) to create a wave effect.
- The illusion of depth is enhanced with staggered `animation-delay` values.
- Ring colors progress from vibrant to soft shades for a dynamic look.
